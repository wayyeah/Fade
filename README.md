# Fade
Fade: Fast and Deployable 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Driving
## Now, the code of Fade-TRT has been uploaded, the training code will be release in this repo when the paper is been accepted.
## We deployed our Fade object detection algorithm on a car equipped with an OS-128 LiDAR and Jetson Orin, and achieved autonomous driving of the car.
